# Data structure
First Goal - Create a linked list using Js to operate in a pile data estructure peforming operations such as insert, delete and check if the pile is empity. Using an array
to dasplay the operations. XD
Remember!-> Linked list isn't array.

Second Goal - Create a Linked-list using objects and set some operations like insert, delete and check if the list is empity.

Third Goal - Create a double-linked-list using objects and set some operations like insert, delete and check if the list is empity.

? Is it possible to create a double-linked matrix with elements that points to the very next and last elements near it as well as the most top and bottom elements near it?ðŸ¤”
